<h4>Organ donation is when a person allows an organ of their own to be removed and transplanted to
 another person, legally, either by consent while the donor is alive or dead with the assent of the next
of kin.Donation may be for research or, more commonly, healthy transplantable organs and tissues may
be donated to be transplanted into another person.Common transplantations include kidneys, heart, 
liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs, bones, bone marrow, skin, and corneas.[1] Some organs and tissues
can be donated by living donors, such as a kidney or part of the liver, part of the pancreas, part of the
lungs or part of the intestines,[3] but most donations occur after the donor has died.[1]In 2017 Spain 
had the highest donor rate in the world at 46.9 per million people, followed by Portugal (34.0 per million),
Belgium (33.6 per million), Croatia (33.0 per million) and the US (32.0 per million).[4]As of February 2, 
2018, there were 115,085 people waiting for life-saving organ transplants in the US.[5] Of these, 74,897 
people were active candidates waiting for a donor.[5] While views of organ donation are positive, there is
a large gap between the numbers of registered donors compared to those awaiting organ donations on a 
global level.

<p><h1><b><font color="#cc0000">Why Organ Donation Is Important?</font></u></B></h1></p>

<p><h4>Why is organ transplant important The reason why I think organ donation is very important, 
because it gives a second chance to life to a person that is in need of an organ because they organs 
have start to fail and shut down. Although clinical issues such as the possibility of the recipient’s body
rejecting the organ have been raised, the social and legal issues—from determining how donations
should be handled and who should receive them, to the black-market practice of organ trafficking—<br> 	
spark the most heated debates. They help save lives and also give second chances to live to many people.</h4>

<p><h1><b><font color="#cc0000">Advantages Of Organ Donation:</font></U></b></h1></P>

<p>
<h4>The biggest advantage to organ donation is it saves lives that would otherwise be lost. 
A single organ donor has the chance to save the lives or improve the quality of life for several people. 
Families of organ donors may be able to correspond with the recipients of their loved one’s organs,
 which may give them the sense that some good came out of tragedy, particularly if the donor were
 very young. Those who donate the whole body often are making contributions to medical advancement,
 as cadavers may be used for the education of medical students. There is no cost to organ donors or their
 families, and the body will not be disfigured for funeral services.</h4>
